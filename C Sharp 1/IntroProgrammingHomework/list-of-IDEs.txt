An integrated development environment (IDE) or interactive development environment is a software application
that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

Visual Studio Express:
Visual Studio has an advantage when it comes to programming. This IDE is mostly used by corporate programmers to produce .NET code.

Eclipse:
This is the best alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio. The interface is a lot cleaner and concise than Visual Studio
 and the languages that are possible to use extend past the .Net Framework. Besides being the number on way to develop Android applications
 via the Android SDK, it is fully extensible to use languages such as Ruby, C, C++ and many many more.

Netbeans:
The is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code which is a bonus. When installing
Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your computer for your testing environment.

Kate:
Kate is exactly how the website describes it, a text editor. Not to be looked down upon as it does a lot more than a regular text edit can 
do and that is what makes this an indispensable product.

Gedit:
gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system is setup. Very useful for the user that is casually
editing code and not undertaking major projects.
